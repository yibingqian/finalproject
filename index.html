  <div style="padding-left: 200px;padding-right: 200px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 50px;">My final project is a barrage shooting game called “Automata”. The framing story is inspired by the game Nier. In the 2200s, since the severe climate change and large scale of robots invasion, people have moved to the moon to live. And some warriors stay at earth instead, fighting with those automata which have already hacked and become dangerous in order to protect the earth. In this game, the players will fly their warcraft and eliminate the hacked robots. It’s different from the traditional shooting game because the bullets last for a long time, so it’s much more difficult for the players to dodge. I consider this kind of shooting game very challenging and I also love playing it, and that’s the primary intention of my final project.
For the game play design, I designed 3 levels for players to choose: easy, normal and hard. To make the game more playable and challenging, I set 3 bosses at each end of the level. The main game mechanics are including the movement of player and robots, bullets and lasers; the elimination of player and robots if dead; the score record. Players mainly use WASD keys and four arrow keys to move, turn and shoot. 
Since the space usage of the game is too large to show on the html screen. After long time trials, I finally have to upload both the js file and embed the processing project on the page.
